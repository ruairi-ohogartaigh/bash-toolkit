# WhatPackageMnger
This is a basic script that used `uname -a` to find the distro in use. It then compares the output to the list of distros in `distro.csv`.
To call the script, you need to be cd'd into the `WhatPackageMnger`, alternatively you could make distro.csv a varaible in `.bashrc` where it points to the fill directory path.
